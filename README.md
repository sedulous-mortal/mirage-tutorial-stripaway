# Mirage Tutorial

This is the Banners app I built off the Reminders official Mirage tutorial.

Check out [miragejs.com/tutorial](https://miragejs.com/tutorial) to follow along. 

Mirage allows you to mock an API so you don't have to build a full API or backend to get your front end fully stubbed out. Loving it!
